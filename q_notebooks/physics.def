Physics is the study of change in space-time.

This definition makes requirements of what tools one can use.

The mathematics must support a place for time and time-like values,
and space and space-like values.

One of anything is never enough to study change. Two is the minimal
count. Not only must one think of 2 events, but also two observers.

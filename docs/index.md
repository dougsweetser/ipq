# IPython Notebooks for Quaternion Mathematical Physics

## A Short Introduction

This is a collection of software tools written to use quaternions and
space-time numbers. Quaternions are the somewhat well known invention of th
other Hamilton, [William Rowan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton). Everyone is
familiar with real numbers that can be added, subtracted, multiplied or
divided. That is grade school math. A good education should introduce the idea
of complex numbers, a pair of numbers that also can do those four operations.
Due to the ugly development of this number, one part is called real, the other
imaginary. There is nothing imaginary about imaginary numbers. Instead it was
meant as an insult to those working with them that survives to this day.

The next question is what numbers come next? For professionaly trained
physicists, the odds are a coin flip that they have ever heard about a
quaternion, the 4 dimensional division algebra that can be added, subtracted,
multiplied, or divided.

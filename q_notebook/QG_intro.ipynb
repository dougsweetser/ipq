    "The quaternion gravity proposal is the imaginary twin of special relativity. Two observers record the difference between two events. When the difference written as quaternion is squared, if the real interval is identical and thus the imaginary parts hereby called space-times-time must have difference, this is the domain of special relativity. Special relativity is viewed as an equivalence class for the real part which uses a Lorentz transformation to go between the two. The space-times-time can be used to determine exactly the relative motion of the two observers."

    "If the space-times-time values are identical, the real interval is different. This is what happens seamingly by chance in general relativity for the Schwarzschild solution in Schwarzschild coordinates outside a static, uncharged, non-rotating spherically-symmetric gravitational source mass. In the quaternion gravity proposal, observers that agree on the three space-times-time values is the equivalence class for gravity. Since this is an eqivalence class, there is a transformation that can be constructed between the two."

    "In the past, I used Mathematica to confirm my algebra was correct (it has caught errors in the past). The software used to be crazy expensive (~\\$2k), but has come down in price (\\$300). Still, I would prefer to use an open source project. This motivated me to look into the iPython Notebook. Since I am a fan of the Python language, I took a closer look. I am quite impressed at the current state of affairs. It looked easy to mix and match real python code with text and images. But how to get iPython Notebook up and running? Anaconda.org is a commercial company that provides a free python environment. They are trying to get by through paid support and cloud services for companies. I liked that after installing anaconda, running \"jupyter notebook\" just worked. Jupyter is the notebook that then attaches to a variety of math tools of your choosing. This blog is being drafted as an iPython Notebook."

The group SU(3) is the symmetry of the strong force that keeps a nucleus together."

    "    The class Qq was written in the hope that group theory would be written in first, not added as needed later. I call these \"space-time numbers\". The problem with such an approach is that one does not use the mathematical field of real numbers. Instead one relies on the set of positive reals. In some ways, this is like reverse engineering some basic computer science. Libraries written in C have a notion of a signed versus unsigned integer. The signed integer behaves like the familiar integers. The unsigned integer is like the positive integers. The difference between the two is whether there is a placeholder for the sign or not. All floats are signed. The modulo operations that work for unsigned integers does not work for floats."

    "The most unusual method is \"reduce\". The Qq class uses 8 positive numbers to represent a quaternion. Any number can be represented an inifinite number of ways, so long as the difference between the positive and negative number remains the same. There is however only one reduced form for a number. That will have either the positive or its additive inverse set to zero (both can be zero also). It is mildly amusing to see a complicated calculation that fills up all eight slots that after the reduce step ends up with precisely the same result as appears from the Qh or Hamilton quaternion class that uses real numbers. It feels uncomfortable to me to see these eight numbers since it is not my experience with calculations. Numbers in Nature do deeply odd things (think of the great boson/fermion divide in how states should be filled). "
